""" Programming exercise:
The length of a list
"""
Please write a function named length which takes a list as its argument and returns the length of the list.



# Write your solution here

def length(my_list):
    count= 0  # defining count variable 
    for i in my_list:
        count = count+1   # looping though a list and increasing count variable
    return count

# You can test your function by calling it within the following block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_list = [3, 6, -4]
    result = length(my_list)
    print(result)
